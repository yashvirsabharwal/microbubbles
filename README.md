# Ultratrace ULM

A standalone microbubble **ULM** (ultrasound localization microscopy) pipeline:
beamforming, SVD clutter filtering, 3D bubble detection and localization,
Kalman track linking, and interactive browser viewers — packaged as a
self-contained Python package with no external acquisition stack.

Built by [Aleph Neuro](https://alephneuro.com).

## How it works

The pipeline has three stages, each exposed as a CLI subcommand:

1. **Beamform** a neutral demodulated-IQ ultratrace into a beamformed H5
   (`acquisitions/<id>/meta/compound_image` plus a saved imaging grid), using
   the optional `mach` GPU kernel. No vendor raw-frame decoding.
2. **Track** — temporal SVD clutter filtering → 3D detection and sub-voxel
   localization → Kalman + Hungarian track linking → smoothing.
3. **View** — export compact binary tracks for the animated 3D **track viewer**,
   or render a rotatable 3D SVD **volume viewer**.

The `run` subcommand chains all three (plus the data download) into one command.

## Install

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). From the repo root:

```bash
uv sync                 # core: download + tracking + viewers (creates .venv)
uv sync --extra mach    # + GPU MACH beamforming (CUDA host only)
```

`uv sync` installs the exact, locked versions (`uv.lock`). Run any command with
`uv run ultratrace-ulm ...`, or activate the environment with
`source .venv/bin/activate` and call `ultratrace-ulm` directly.

The core install has no GPU dependency. Beamforming (`beamform`, and the
beamform step of `run`) needs the `mach` extra and a CUDA host.

## Quick start

One command — download the sample data, beamform it, track, and build the 3D
track viewer:

```bash
uv run ultratrace-ulm run --spatial-tgc --frame-rate 222
cd outputs/viewer && python3 -m http.server 8080   # open http://localhost:8080
```

Already have a beamformed file? Skip download and beamforming:

```bash
ultratrace-ulm run --beamformed beamformed.h5 --frame-rate 222
```

> `run` downloads ~98 GB and beamforms on a CUDA GPU. To avoid both, pass
> `--beamformed`. For full control over any stage, use the dedicated
> subcommands below instead.

## Commands

Run `ultratrace-ulm <command> --help` for the complete flag list of any command.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `download` | Fetch the public sample ultratrace (resumable). |
| `run` | End-to-end demo: download → beamform → track → track viewer. |
| `beamform` | MACH beamform a raw neutral ultratrace into a beamformed H5. |
| `track` | Streaming ULM tracking → smoothed tracks (+ optional bins). |
| `track-export` | `track` plus binary `.bin` export in one step. |
| `export` | Smooth and export `.bin` files from an existing track pickle. |
| `track-viewer` | Build the animated 3D track-flow viewer bundle. |
| `volume` | Build the rotatable 3D SVD volume viewer bundle. |
| `launcher` | Write a landing page linking several viewer bundles. |
| `doctor` | Check that the standalone runtime imports cleanly. |

### download

Resumable download (pure stdlib, no `curl` needed). A sanitized neutral
ultratrace — demodulated IQ plus transmit delays and a beamforming-only config,
no raw frames or device metadata — hosted on Cloudflare R2 (~98 GB, 223
acquisitions):

```bash
ultratrace-ulm download --output sample_ultratrace.h5
```

An interrupted download resumes in place when re-run. Use `--force` to restart,
`--url` to point at a different source.

### run

```bash
ultratrace-ulm run \
  --work-dir outputs \
  --frame-rate 222 \
  --svd-method adaptive \
  --spatial-tgc \
  --min-length 35
```

Writes everything under `--work-dir` (default `outputs/`): the downloaded
sample, `beamformed.h5`, `tracks.pkl` / `tracks_smoothed.pkl`, `tracks_min*.bin`,
and the `viewer/` bundle. Stages whose outputs already exist are skipped unless
`--force` is given.

- `--input RAW.h5` — beamform this raw file instead of downloading the sample.
- `--beamformed B.h5` — start from an existing beamformed file (skip download
  and beamforming).
- `--frame-rate` is required by adaptive SVD; the sample runs at 222 Hz.

### beamform

```bash
ultratrace-ulm beamform \
  --input sample_ultratrace.h5 \
  --output beamformed.h5 \
  --spatial-tgc
```

Beamform a slice with `--acq-start` / `--num-acqs` / `--acq-step`, or the whole
file with `--all-acqs`. Requires the `[mach]` extra and a CUDA GPU.

### track

```bash
ultratrace-ulm track \
  --beamformed beamformed.h5 \
  --tracks outputs/tracks.pkl \
  --svd-method adaptive --frame-rate 222 \
  --sigma-threshold 2.0 --subpixel centroid \
  --tracking kalman --min-track-length 5
```

Writes `outputs/tracks.pkl` and a smoothed `outputs/tracks_smoothed.pkl`. Add
`--export-dir`/`--min-lengths` (or use `track-export`) to also emit `.bin` files.

#### Recommended recipe

For non-stationary microbubble tracks, prefer **adaptive SVD with
`--temporal-sigma 0`**:

```bash
ultratrace-ulm track \
  --beamformed beamformed.h5 --tracks outputs/tracks.pkl \
  --svd-method adaptive --frame-rate 222 --knee-filter \
  --temporal-sigma 0 --sigma-threshold 2.0 --svd-low-cutoff 0.1 \
  --min-distance 2 --smoothing-sigma 1.0 --tracking kalman \
  --max-gap 3 --min-track-length 5 --max-cost 10
```

A large `--temporal-sigma` (e.g. 7) with the `fast` SVD variant tends to track
stationary tissue/clutter: many more tracks that barely move. Adaptive SVD with
no temporal blur matches the production reference (~260 tracks/acquisition,
genuinely flowing).

### export

Re-smooth and re-export `.bin` files from an existing pickle without re-tracking:

```bash
ultratrace-ulm export \
  --tracks outputs/tracks.pkl \
  --export-dir outputs \
  --min-lengths 5 20 50
```

### track-viewer

Build the animated 3D track-flow viewer (Three.js point-flow):

```bash
ultratrace-ulm track-viewer \
  --tracks outputs/tracks_smoothed.pkl \
  --output-dir outputs/viewer \
  --min-length 35 --beamformed beamformed.h5
cd outputs/viewer && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

`--beamformed` is optional and only used to sample per-point B-mode intensity.

### volume

Build the rotatable 3D SVD volume viewer with track overlay:

```bash
ultratrace-ulm volume \
  --beamformed beamformed.h5 \
  --tracks outputs/tracks_smoothed.pkl \
  --output-dir outputs/volume
cd outputs/volume && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### launcher

Serve several viewer bundles behind one landing page. Export the `track-viewer`
and `volume` bundles into a shared directory, then:

```bash
ultratrace-ulm launcher \
  --output-dir outputs \
  --title "Ultratrace ULM" \
  --subtitle "adaptive SVD" \
  --viewer "viewer/|3D Track-Flow Viewer|Animated point-flow of tracks.|✨" \
  --viewer "volume/|3D SVD Volume Viewer|Rotatable super-resolution volume.|🧊"
```

This writes `index.html` + `viewers.json`. Each `--viewer` is
`HREF|TITLE|DESCRIPTION|EMOJI` (only the href is required) and may be repeated.

## Viewing

Every viewer bundle is static — serve its directory with any file server:

```bash
cd outputs/viewer && python3 -m http.server 8080   # http://localhost:8080
```
